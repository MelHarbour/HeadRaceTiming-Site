## Building and deploying

1. You'll need an appropriate database (details are in the Migrations folder) hosted somewhere, and then open up enough permissions to contact it.
1. Create an appropriate `connectionStrings.json` file in the root of the project containing the database credentials. For obvious reasons, this isn't checked into the project.
